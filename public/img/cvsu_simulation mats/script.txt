CAMPUS SEAL

This is a product of the visionary and agressive minds of students, faculty, employees and admistration of the campus. 
The shape of the seal is similar to the shape of the University seal, a square with 1/3 of one its angles cut to form a base. This reminds us that the campus is committed to the University in pursuit of its vision, mission, goals and objectives..

The three (3) triangular border lines of the seal represent the trilogy function of the campus: INSTRUCTION,

RESEARCH and EXTENSION. The words TANZA 2007 are written in deep purple, a dominant color of a Tanzanite which is an anniversary

stone for Tanzanians.

The big letter N of Tanza reminds us of the noble purpose of establishing the campus. The torch behind it represents the educational programs and undertakings with a flame designed as CvSU which is the adopted acronym of Cavite State University. The three (3) horizontal base lines of the big letter N signify the commitment of the campus to

the tenets of the University- TRUTH, SERVICE and EXCELLENCE.

The year 2007 was the year CVSU- Tanza Campus has its humble beginnings.
